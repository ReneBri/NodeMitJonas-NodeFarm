So I'm diving deeper into Node after spending a lot of time on React.

This is bare basic Node routing with template pages, which read a json file.

This was cool because in a previous course we spent little time on vanilla Node and jumped quite quickly to express.
I liked here how it explains how node can read a html file, replace template strings with json data and dynamically spit out that data.

Obviously very basic but fun to make.
